This is planning for tonight


Tweet.all
@tweet.each do |tweet|
    element - tweet.status
        @clickedtweet.find_each(tweet.id) do |tweet|
            tweet.emoji.map do |emoji|
            element - display emojis

        element create method for clicked tweet table

        sample idea - when taking emoji codes from clicked tweet array match them against class of counters with those displayed - Probs better


This is what we should try to get working tonight
